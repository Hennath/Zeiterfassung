The return statement in the on_tag_detected function is not being used because the function is not being called in a way that captures its return value. The on_tag_detected function is being passed as a callback to the listen method of the CustomMFRC522 class, which means that the on_tag_detected function will be called by the thread created by the listen method, rather than being called directly.

This means that when the on_tag_detected function returns a value, it is not being used by the code that called the listen method. To fix this, you can use the with app.test_request_context() context manager to create a fake request context, and then use the process_response method of the Flask app to handle the response returned by the on_tag_detected function.

Here is an example of how you can update the listen method in the CustomMFRC522 class to handle the return value of the on_tag_detected function:

class CustomMFRC522(mfrc522.SimpleMFRC522):
    def _listen(self, on_tag_detected):
        while True:
            # Check for a new tag
            id, text = self.read()
            print("reading.............")

            # If a tag is detected, call the callback function
            if id:
                # Create a fake request context
                with app.test_request_context():
                    # Call the callback function
                    response = on_tag_detected(id)

                    # Handle the response
                    if response:
                        app.process_response(response)

Now, when the on_tag_detected function returns a response, it will be handled by the Flask app and the user will be redirected to the new page.

You may also need to update the on_tag_detected function to add the app.app_context() context manager around the app.test_request_context() context manager, like this:

def on_tag_detected(tag_id):
    with app.app_context():
        with app.test_request_context():
            # Look up the user and clock them in or out

            # Redirect the user to the index page
            return redirect("/index")

This is necessary because the on_tag_detected function is being called by a thread that does not have the Flask app context, so it needs to be explicitly pushed onto the context stack in order to use Flask functions such as redirect and flash.

The process_response method of the Flask app is a method that is called to finalize the handling of a request. It takes a response object as an argument, which should be a Response object created by the Flask app or one of its dependencies. The process_response method modifies the response object as necessary (for example, by adding headers), and then returns the modified response object to be sent to the client.

In the context of the code you provided, the process_response method is being used to handle the response object returned by the on_tag_detected function. The on_tag_detected function is called by the CustomMFRC522 class when a RFID tag is detected, and it is expected to return a response object that will be handled by the Flask app.

If the on_tag_detected function returns a response object, the process_response method is called to modify the response object and prepare it for sending back to the client. For example, if the on_tag_detected function returns a redirect response, the process_response method will add the necessary headers to the response object to redirect the client to the specified URL.

Here is an example of how you might use the process_response method to handle the response returned by the on_tag_detected function:

class CustomMFRC522(mfrc522.SimpleMFRC522):
    def _listen(self, on_tag_detected):
        while True:
            # Check for a new tag
            id, text = self.read()
            print("reading.............")

            # If a tag is detected, call the callback function
            if id:
                # Create a fake request context
                with app.test_request_context():
                    # Call the callback function
                    response = on_tag_detected(id)

                    # Handle the response
                    if response:
                        # Process the response and prepare it for sending to the client
                        response = app.process_response(response)

                        # Send the response to the client
                        return response

In this example, the process_response method is called to modify the response object returned by the on_tag_detected function, and then the modified response object is returned by the _listen method to be sent back to the client.

Note that in this example, the response object is being returned directly from the _listen method, which means that it will be sent to the client immediately. If you want to delay sending the response object until later, you can store it in a global variable or a thread-safe queue and then send it at a later time when it is appropriate to do so.

To handle different cases depending on which page the user is currently viewing, you can use the request object provided by Flask to access the current request information. The request object contains properties such as the current URL and the request method (e.g. GET or POST), which you can use to determine which page the user is currently viewing.

Here is an example of how you might use the request object in the on_tag_detected function to handle different cases depending on the current page:

def on_tag_detected(tag_id):
    with app.app_context():
        with app.test_request_context():
            # Check the current URL to determine which page the user is viewing
            if request.path == "/kommen":
                # Handle the case where the user is viewing the /kommen page

                # Look up the user and clock them in
                u = User.query.filter(User.personalnummer == tag_id).first()
                if not u:
                    flash("Die Personalnummer ist keinem Benutzer zugeordnet!")
                    return redirect("/index")

                stempel = u.stempeln("kommen")
                flash(stempel)
                return redirect("/index")

            elif request.path == "/gehen":
                # Handle the case where the user is viewing the /gehen page

                # Look up the user and clock them out
                u = User.query.filter(User.personalnummer == tag_id).first()
                if not u:
                    flash("Die Personalnummer ist keinem Benutzer zugeordnet!")
                    return redirect("/index")

                stempel = u.stempeln("gehen")
                flash(stempel)
                return redirect("/index")

            else:
                # Handle the case where the user is viewing a different page

                # Do something else...

In this example, the on_tag_detected function checks the request.path property to determine which page the user is currently viewing, and then performs different actions depending on the value of request.path. If the user is viewing the /kommen page, the function looks up the user with the specified RFID tag ID and clocks them in. If the user is viewing the /gehen page, the function looks up the user and clocks them out. Otherwise, the function performs a default action.

You can use this approach to handle different cases depending on the current page in the Flask app, and to perform different actions when a RFID tag is detected.
